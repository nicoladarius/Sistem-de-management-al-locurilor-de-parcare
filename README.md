## Introduction
A parking space management system is a technological solution used to manage and monitor the available parking spaces in a specific area or parking structure. This system can be implemented in both public and private parking lots, such as office buildings, shopping centers, or public institutions.

These systems can provide data and analytics regarding the usage of parking spots in real-time or over a certain period of time. This information can be used to improve system efficiency, better plan parking management, and optimize traffic flow in the area.

## Installation
- Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the application: `selectorLocuriParcare.py`
2. Select the parking spot positions in the image.
3. Run the application: `main.py`
